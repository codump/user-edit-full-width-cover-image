# User editable full width cover image with position input and preview.
Cover images are a common thing now a days. In this example I have made a full width version with a fixed height. But then the issue came up on how to vertically align the image. Every image needs another alignment then the other. So this I solved by adding a range input, so the end user can adjust it themselves easily.
